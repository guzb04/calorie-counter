super cool calorie couinter made for gymbros like me ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

pretty straight forward. you compile and you run main following this syntax:

main <add | get> [options]

options are the following:

add -protein (int) -calories (int)

get -days(int)

commands are pretty self explainatory

get makes an average of the protein and calories within the last days, according to the flag -days

add adds the given -protein and -calories to data.json, which comes empty inside the repo by default
